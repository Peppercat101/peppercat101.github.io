          <p>
            My name is Melissa Peters. I am an enthusiastic and dedicated
            Software Developer. Developing software is not just another job but
            an extension of my identity. I care greatly about the software I
            create, in both user interface design and coding style. I have
            experience in multiple web technologies and Java-based desktop
            applications. I am a fast learner and always willing to learn new
            technologies. I enjoy helping others with coding problems and find
            it easy to understand other people's code. I have been in Canada for
            4 years, working as a Full Stack developer. My working experience
            includes agile and non-agile teams with pairing, mobbing and TDD.
